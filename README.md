Introduces tool that connects pipes from one block to another.

### What is the best part of modded Minecraft? Yes, that's objectively correct, it's to connect pipes between machines, whether it be Energy Pipes, Item Pipes or even Fluid Pipes. However, what is the worse part of modded Minecraft?

# ITS TO DIG THE BLOCKS TO PLACE THOSE PIPES AND THEN FILL THEM BACK UP SO THE PIPES WON'T BE IN YOUR WAY.


This mod tries to rectify that.



### How does it work?
* Hold the Pipe Connector in your hand and Shift + Mouse wheel to set the depth you want the Pipe to go to.
* Hold a pipe in your off-hand and the Pipe Connector in your main hand, and Shift + Right-Click a block to set the first position, the do it again on another block to set the second Position, to place the Pipes.
* Shift + Right click the air to reset positions.
* Shift + Right Click on the same block to reset positions.
